# Task Admin
### MVP and app .
As MVP I focused on a basic functionality of creating/saving/editing/deleting tasks.

-	Create a task.
-	Read your list of tasks.
-	Edit a task.
-	Delete a task.

## Tech stack used
React
Typescript
JSON-Server (to mock API)
Material UI library
Tailwindcss

### Settings
You have two different folders, one is the fake api (server api) and the other is the frontend. To be able to start the application you will need two commands, first:
`npm i`
and then:
`npm run start`
This in each folder, by default port 3006 will be the server api and the frontend port 3000, make sure you have them free.
